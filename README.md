This repository contains the complete infrastructure-as-code and application source for my personal portfolio, running on a distributed, 5-node Raspberry Pi cluster. This is a living project designed to showcase a deep, practical understanding of modern DevOps, cloud-native architecture, and full-stack development in a real-world, self-hosted environment.

### üèõÔ∏è **Cluster Architecture**

The entire system is designed with a clear separation of concerns, utilizing a secure overlay network (Tailscale) for inter-node communication and isolating management services from the public-facing application.


*A high-level overview of the portfolio cluster architecture.*

### ‚úÖ **Core Features**

* **Automated Deployments:** Push a commit to `main` and a GitLab CI/CD pipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys the application containers.
* **Live Observability:** A real-time Grafana dashboard visualizes health metrics (CPU, RAM, temp) and logs from every node in the cluster.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The entire cluster setup, from installing Docker to configuring networking, is automated and version-controlled with Ansible.
* **AI-Powered Chatbot:** An interactive "AMA" bot, trained on my personal history and served via a dedicated Python API, allows for a unique way to engage with my resume.
* **Secure Remote Access:** The entire cluster is accessible for management over a secure Tailscale (WireGuard) VPN, with no exposed SSH ports.
* **Self-Hosted Analytics:** A privacy-first Umami instance provides web analytics without relying on third-party services.

###  Raspberry Pi Cluster: Hardware & Roles

The cluster is comprised of five Raspberry Pis, each with a specialized role:

* üîπ **Pi 0 (3B+ 512MB):** Serves as a dedicated, low-power resume host.
* üîπ **Pi 1 (5 4GB):** The **Automation & Gateway Node**. It runs the GitLab CI/CD runner, a secure Tailscale VPN gateway, and an internal-only Caddy reverse proxy for management dashboards.
* üîπ **Pi 2 (5 4GB):** The **Web & Observability Hub**. This hosts the primary portfolio website, its backend API, a public-facing reverse proxy, and the central Prometheus & Grafana monitoring services.
* üîπ **Pi 3 (5 8GB):** The **Data Hub**. It runs a PostgreSQL database for logging visitor interactions and the self-hosted Umami analytics platform.
* üîπ **Pi 4 (5 16GB):** The **AI Agent Host**. This powerhouse Pi is dedicated to hosting the custom-trained "AMA" (Ask Me Anything) chatbot.
