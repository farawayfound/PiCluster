# Pi-runner
The Pi 5 with 4GB RAM is adequately provisioned as a GIT runner for CI/CD workflow automations. It also serves as a monitoring stack. While Grafana and Prometheus are resource-intensive, a 4B Pi 5 can manage them effectively for a small cluster, especially when paired with a lightweight time-series database.
