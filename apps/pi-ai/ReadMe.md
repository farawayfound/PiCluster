The Pi 5 with 16GB RAM is correctly identified as the only viable node for hosting the Large Language Model (LLM). Research consistently shows that running even small, quantized LLMs is a memory-intensive operation, with models often requiring several gigabytes of RAM just to load, plus additional memory for the context window during inference. The 16GB model is essential for this task.
