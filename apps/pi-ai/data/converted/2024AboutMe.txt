Pleased to meet you, I’m David. I’m currently a full-time software engineer, full-time student, full-time husband and new dad (since I work fully remote and haven’t moved my office into my basement yet). I began my tech education by dabbling in embedded systems, CAD, and web design while enlisted in the USAF as a structural “engineer”, simply a jack-of-all-trades handyman. To kickstart my career and take advantage of the remote work boom in 2020, I qualified for and completed a transition program with Microsoft and ERAU for separating veterans and lined up a technical job. Since then, I’ve learned most of what I know on the job and taking certifications: my daily work responsibilities involve SQL (databases), C# (backend logic), and PowerShell (services and modules) all hosted on Azure. My employer is a health care patient tracking software company based out of Dallas, and I’ve never been to the office despite convincing my manager and teammates to come out here a couple of times to snowboard. I have been in my current role for almost 3 years, and I feel like the bachelor’s degree I’m about to earn by the end of the semester is going to help me get to the next step in my career.
	I have had to plan, own, and deliver projects individually and as a contributing member of a team both while in service for the USAF and as a Software Engineer in my most recent role. Most recently, I’m in a small team (3 members) with the goal to fully automate a very time-consuming patient data reporting process for State compliance.
