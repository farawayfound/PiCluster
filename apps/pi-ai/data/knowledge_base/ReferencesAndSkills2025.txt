Below are some examples of my experience with each of the desired knowledge areas:

Log Analysis (JSON / XML / CSV)
Built targeted Splunk searches and alerts to triage production issues across .NET services.
Wrote Python scripts to mass-format logs: flatten nested JSON, extract XML, and sanitize CSV edge cases (embedded commas/quotes/newlines) for bulk ingestion and side-by-side diffs.
Parsed exception patterns and noisy stack traces into normalized fields for trend analysis and regression checks.
Product Support / CSM responsibilities
Resolved 300+ engineering tickets at OneTrust with ~98% acceptance, translating technical findings into clear, customer-friendly updates and KBs that empowered Tier-1/CSM teams.
Ran Tier-3 triage at HCHB, coordinating across dev/DBA/infra; participated in on-call/major incidents, driving comms and handoffs until resolution.
Authored reusable templates/diagnostic playbooks that reduced repeat escalations and improved resolution times.
Python — HCHB State Report Automation
Delivered a compliance reporting automation built on Python that saved 500+ hours/year by orchestrating data pulls (ServiceNow API), parsing JSON payloads, driving parameterized T-SQL scripts for final outputs, shaping to CSV/Excel, and shipping to end user.
Implemented input validation, error handling, and audit logging to make runs deterministic and supportable; integrated with JAMS scheduler.
Java — Convercent Localization Framework
Implemented a scalable Java framework (message catalogs/resource bundles, fallback locales, extraction scripts), enabling launch in 3 new languages and supporting 400k+ international users.
Optimized build/pipeline steps so new locales could ship without code churn.
