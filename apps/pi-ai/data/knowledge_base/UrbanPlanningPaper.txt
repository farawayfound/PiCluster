Shifting Gears: Why People-Centric Design Must Replace Car-Centric Planning
Urban design significantly impacts daily life, influencing how we commute, interact socially, our physical, mental, and even financial health. Historically, American cities, Denver included, have embraced car-centric infrastructure characterized by expansive highways, abundant parking, and sprawling developments. However, growing evidence indicates that this design philosophy is financially unsustainable, environmentally damaging, socially isolating, and detrimental to public health. In contrast, people-centric urban design prioritizes public transit, microtransit (human powered or electric motor assisted bicycles, scooters, skateboards, and my favorite, the OneWheel) and pedestrian-friendly environments. The results are clear and proven: healthier communities, economic resilience, and improved quality of life. Denver and similar cities must urgently shift to this approach. With this urgency in mind, it is essential to examine the multifaceted costs of car-centric development, starting with its hidden economic burdens.
Economically, car-centric infrastructure presents hidden and recurring costs. Advocates of highway expansions argue such projects stimulate local economies through job creation and improved logistics (Kotkin). While short-term economic boosts from construction are apparent, these gains diminish quickly. James Brown’s Confessions of a Recovering Engineer highlights how expansions initially reduce congestion but inevitably attract more drivers –a  phenomenon known as induced demand— resulting  in ongoing maintenance and escalating costs for both the municipality/city as well as each individual driver (Brown 72). Donald Shoup further reveals that mandated parking lots displace productive land uses, limiting economic vitality (Shoup 15). Investing in people-centric infrastructure, conversely, creates lasting prosperity by supporting local businesses, boosting property values in walkable areas, and reducing public expenditure on healthcare costs associated with pollution and sedentary lifestyles.
Socially, car-centric designs isolate neighborhoods, creating pedestrian "dead zones" and reducing local business foot traffic (Brown 94). Advocates of car-centric design often argue that cars empower freedom of movement, especially for people in rural areas or those with mobility challenges who rely on vehicles for independence. They also insist that automobiles offer privacy and convenience unmatched by public transit or cycling (Kotkin). While this argument has merit in regions lacking public transportation, it overlooks a crucial point: car dependency is not true freedom if it forces everyone into vehicle ownership just to participate in society. In cities like Denver, low-income families often face the harsh reality of mandatory car ownership, leading to transportation poverty (Litman, 2023). Furthermore, walkable neighborhoods inherently include accommodations for people with mobility devices and safer street crossings for all ages and abilities, enhancing accessibility beyond what car-centric planning achieves. Walkable, transit-oriented communities foster organic social interactions and sustain small businesses that thrive on foot traffic, strengthening social bonds that isolated car trips simply cannot replicate.
Environmentally, the reliance on cars significantly contributes to pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and rapid infrastructure deterioration. Proponents of car-centric urbanism often counter that advances in electric vehicle technology will mitigate environmental impacts, making it unnecessary to redesign cities. While EVs do reduce tailpipe emissions, they fall short of addressing the full spectrum of environmental harm caused by car-centric development. The production of electric vehicles is resource-intensive, consuming vast amounts of lithium, cobalt, and rare earth metals, with mining processes that carry severe ecological and human rights consequences (Pitron). Additionally, EVs do not alleviate the issues of traffic congestion, airborne contaminants from tires, land consumption, or the harmful urban heat island effect perpetuated by extensive asphalt surfaces. In contrast, transitioning to sustainable transportation modes like public transit, cycling, and walking not only cuts emissions but also conserves land, reduces water runoff, and improves urban air quality (Hauptman & Bateni). Sustainable transport design results in greener cities holistically and organically, rather than merely swapping one fuel type for another and outsourcing the emissions further up the energy and production pipeline while maintaining the unsustainable flaws of car dependency. 
Likewise, Donald Shoup’s The High Cost of Free Parking demonstrates that mandated parking lots displace productive land uses, diminishing municipal revenue potential (Shoup 15). Moreover, car-centric development inflates household transportation costs, disproportionately burdening lower-income families who spend a higher share of income on vehicle ownership and maintenance (Litman, 2023). Rather than relying on these short-lived economic arguments, investing in people-centric infrastructure creates enduring prosperity through thriving local businesses, increased property values in walkable areas, and reduced public expenditure on road maintenance and healthcare costs associated with sedentary lifestyles and pollution. Removing minimum parking requirements would also bring businesses closer together and allow new businesses to sprout where it was not geographically or economically feasible before, which incentivizes walking and microtransit, reducing car throughput, which in turn allows for streets to be smaller, and this continues in a positive feedback loop with the effect of bringing all of us closer together.
International examples provide valuable insights into successful people-centric planning. The Netherlands, renowned for its cycling infrastructure, was not always a microtransit eutopia. Amsterdam, for instance, had to actively prioritize bicycles and public transportation over private vehicles, leading to reduced congestion and pollution while enhancing community cohesion (Pucher and Buehler 78). The picture attached is the nightmarish Jokinen Plan proposed by American urban planners in the 1960’s for what Amsterdam could look like in 2000, and it once had local political support (Jokinen). Countless large roads through the city had to be reimagined and rebuilt.

Similarly, Paris has increasingly embraced people-centric urban strategies. Mayor Anne Hidalgo's "15-minute city" concept ensures residents have essential services within a short walk or bike ride, greatly reducing reliance on cars and enhancing livability and environmental sustainability (Moreno 93). Most tourists to those cities do not realize that they once had sprawling roads cutting through many spaces that have been revitalized for people and cyclists to thrive.
The dominance of car-centric design has notably eroded "third places"—informal community spaces distinct from homes and workplaces. Ray Oldenburg describes third places as critical social hubs like cafes, libraries, parks, independent businesses, community centers, and your adored Local Bike Shop. They foster social interaction, community cohesion, and cultural engagement. Extensive road networks and sprawling developments have diminished these spaces through isolation, reducing opportunities for spontaneous socialization and weakening community ties. Reinvesting in people-centric infrastructure can help restore these vital communal spaces, rejuvenating local culture and promoting civic engagement.
In the absence of Third Places, the Big Box Store multiplied. Not only do they require massive parking lots which are awful as aforementioned, they hardly pay any taxes (often less than equivalent vacant land) due to the “dark store theory” legal trickery. In short, they argue that “unlike many other commercial properties, free standing ‘big-box’ stores… are not constructed for the purpose of thereafter selling or leasing the property in the marketplace” and therefore should be taxed as if they were worthless because their future value is worthless after the tenant leaves when market conditions are unfavorable or the building is obsolete (Shapiro). The land is then worthless, a dead heat island, and future owners incur large costs to demolish and build.
Reflecting on my personal experiences, I initially adopted a car-light lifestyle when living in a townhouse conveniently near grocery stores and recreation areas. Despite daily car commutes as a USAF airman, I discovered hidden community gems through cycling and walking—experiences impossible from behind a windshield. Later, transitioning to civilian life, my wife and I prioritized walkability when moving to Denver, facing significant challenges and ultimately paying a premium for a walkable home. Such premiums reflect an inequitable barrier that restricts car-light lifestyles to those financially capable, highlighting the urgent need for systemic change. Although paying the premium for a walkable location and my remote work career allowed me to spend a fraction of the fuel and maintenance cost recreationally driving my [inefficient] 4x4 as most hybrid and electric vehicle drivers spend on their ongoing costs, everyone deserves the ability to choose a car-light lifestyle without facing financial barriers—to  not have life locked behind a paywall.
Historically, Denver’s Union Station exemplifies successful people-centric infrastructure. Established in 1881, Union Station initially spurred economic growth, community engagement, and efficient transportation (Noel et al. 85). Its diminished role today—overshadowed by automotive and air travel—underscores the lost economic and social opportunities resulting from car dependency. The inconvenience of chronic traffic on Peña Blvd and time consuming pre- and post-travel personal vehicle queues at Denver International Airport further highlights the failure of car-centric design. Revitalizing rail infrastructure not only reduces road congestion but also restores community hubs, exemplifying truly people-centric urban planning. The Europeans have railways connecting every ski town, why can’t we?
Ultimately, shifting toward people-centric urban planning addresses the intertwined economic, social, and environmental challenges that car-centric designs exacerbate. Cities like Denver must embrace holistic urban policies, prioritizing walkability, cycling infrastructure, reliable public transit, and accessible microtransit solutions. Everyone deserves the opportunity to experience a life less dependent on cars, without financial barriers or premium costs. Urban planning must serve people first, fostering vibrant, sustainable, and equitable communities.
