2017 Summary: 

I was born in Xi’an China, raised in Montreal Canada, and went to High School in Texas. Moving around so much denied me any chance of establishing a cultural or geographical “home base”. Consequently, I’ve always had trouble fitting in any niche. It’s not for the lack of trying; I’ve joined groups in arts, athletics, military, even fraternities, only to come to the realization that I need develop my own identity from scratch. I will have to expand my horizons. 

There is no better way of expanding horizons than to travel. And I don’t mean hitting Tripadvisor’s “Top 10 things to do in [insert city here]” like checking boxes off a shopping list. I mean to live life like the locals, to be immersed in foreign cultures. With this in mind, I hope to embark on a global journey to learn about our world, the people who inhabit it, and find myself in the process.
